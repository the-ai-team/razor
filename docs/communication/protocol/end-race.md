```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server
    participant V as Viewer

    loop Waiting players to end their race locally
        rect rgba(191, 223, 255, 0.5)
            C->>S: Socket Message [Sock01]
            S-->>S: Update race
        end
    end

    Note over S,C: After server race timeout

    break Server waiting time ends
        rect rgba(191, 223, 255, 0.5)
            S-->>C: Socket Command [Sock02]
            S-->>S: Update race
            Note over S,C: If a player has not ended.ยน
        end
    end

    S-->>S: End race
    S->>V: Socket Message [Sock03]
```

ยน Player should send either [Sock1] (end by timeout) or race text completed type log to consider as race ended.
